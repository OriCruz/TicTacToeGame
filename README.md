Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game where each take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 board with X or O makrs. The player who wins is determined by placing 3 of the same marks diagonal, row or column. If both players fail to do so, it is an authomatic draw. 

## About the project
This is the christmas version of the classic game of tic tac toe. Where the player who starts the game is completetly random. The game structure: 
- The game starts when the user clicks the **Start** button 
- After that player 1 will select their mark (either X or O) and the game will start. 
- Once either player gets into the winning state the modal will display with a message and a gif. Depending on the player that wins, a different message will be dsiplayed and the win counter will increase.
